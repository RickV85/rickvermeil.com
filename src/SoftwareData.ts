    description: `This app was inspired by an idea that I had while I was rebuilding my mountain bike suspension. I realized that it was not only difficult to keep track of the last time I serviced my suspension, but it was extremely difficult to accurately determine how many hours I had ridden the bike since that date which is how suspension manufacturers prescribe their recommended service intervals.
    
    I set out to create an app that addresses this problem that is common to all mountain bikers that also meets the requirements of Turing's School of Software and Design Mod 3 (3rd quarter) final project. This project had a tight timeline of 6 days so I had to work very hard to complete this app, learning new tech like OAuth2.0 in the process.
    
    This project marks a watershed moment for me. Only a year ago, I could have never imagined I could build a complex application that solves a real world problem from design to deployment in 6 days on my own. After this project, I feel that given the time and resources, I could build absolutely anything I want to.
    
    Please note that this application requires a user to have a Strava account and use it to track mountain bike rides for it to operate correctly. For those that are not mountain bikers, please enjoy the video above and reach out to me for a demonstration.`,

    description: `Welcome to Backcountry Bookings - your ultimate destination for all your camping needs! Our website is a comprehensive conglomerate of campsite information from around the country, designed to provide campers with an easy-to-navigate and reliable platform for finding the perfect campsite for their outdoor adventures.

    Nominated by peers as one of the best applications built in the quarter to participate in Turing's Demo Comp. This application was built by a full-stack team of seven students for the group's final Capstone project at the Turing School of Software and Design.
    
    This application is designed to allow a user to research US National Park campgrounds by a variety of options including by state, park name, campground name and their current location. The user is presented with search result options which they can browse and then select one for more information or add to their favorites which will appear on the home page. On the details page for a campground, they will receive vital information about the campground that will help them plan their trip.

    The campground seeker can browse images of the selected campground, an interactive meet provided by Google Maps API, attributes of the campground and a review section that allows a user to submit their opinion of the campground as well as a photo which is stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket. Finally, the user can click links to either be navigated directly to the campground from their location or book a site on the NPS reservation system Recreation.gov.`,
