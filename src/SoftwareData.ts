    description: `This app was inspired by an idea that I had while I was rebuilding my mountain bike suspension. I realized that it was not only difficult to keep track of the last time I serviced my suspension, but it was extremely difficult to accurately determine how many hours I had ridden the bike since that date which is how suspension manufacturers prescribe their recommended service intervals.\n\nI set out to create an app that addresses this problem that is common to all mountain bikers that also meets the requirements of Turing's School of Software and Design Mod 3 (3rd quarter) final project. This project had a tight timeline of 6 days so I had to work very hard to complete this app, learning new tech like OAuth2.0 in the process.\n\nThis project marks a watershed moment for me. Only a year ago, I would have never imagined I could build a complex application that solves a real world problem from design to deployment in 6 days on my own. After this project, I feel that given the time and resources, I could build absolutely anything I want to.\n\nPlease note that this application requires a user to have a Strava account and use it to track mountain bike rides for it to operate correctly. For those that are not mountain bikers, please enjoy the video above and reach out to me for a demonstration.`,
